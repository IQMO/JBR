# Task ID: 66
# Title: Implement Unified Real-Data Testing Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 10, 14, 37, 54
# Priority: critical
# Description: Develop a unified real-data testing strategy to ensure consistent test patterns using actual API calls and database connections, addressing inconsistencies in mock vs. real-data usage.
# Details:
1.  Establish a single `.env` source configuration for all tests.
2.  Implement a `BYBIT_TESTNET` toggle to control real money vs. testnet environments.
3.  Clearly separate sensitive operations within the testing framework.
4.  Develop production-ready test patterns that validate actual backend functionality.
5.  Minimize changes to existing code while ensuring tests provide production confidence through real-environment validation.
6.  Refactor existing tests to align with the new unified strategy, prioritizing tests related to core trading engine components and exchange integrations.
7.  Implement a mechanism to automatically switch between mock and real data based on the `BYBIT_TESTNET` toggle.
8.  Document the new testing strategy and provide examples for future test development.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that all tests use the single `.env` source configuration.
2.  Test the `BYBIT_TESTNET` toggle to ensure it correctly switches between real money and testnet environments.
3.  Confirm that sensitive operations are properly separated and protected during testing.
4.  Execute all tests and verify that they pass in both real money and testnet environments.
5.  Monitor test execution time and resource usage to ensure stability and minimal impact on performance.
6.  Validate that the tests accurately reflect production scenarios and provide confidence in the system's functionality.
7.  Ensure that the documentation is clear and comprehensive, enabling developers to easily create new tests following the established patterns.
