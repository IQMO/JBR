# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a basic risk management framework with stop-loss functionality.
# Details:
Implement stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Monitor positions and trigger stop-loss orders when necessary. Allow users to configure stop-loss parameters. Use ccxt's API to implement stop loss orders. Ensure the risk management framework is effective and can protect the trading engine from excessive losses.

# Test Strategy:
Test stop-loss functionality by simulating trades and verifying that stop-loss orders are triggered correctly. Verify that the trading engine can use the risk management framework to limit potential losses.
