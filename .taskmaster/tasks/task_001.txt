# Task ID: 1
# Title: Monorepo Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the monorepo structure with separate packages for backend, frontend, and shared code.
# Details:
Use pnpm or yarn workspaces to create the monorepo. Create 'backend', 'frontend', and 'shared' directories. Initialize TypeScript in each package with appropriate configurations. Use `pnpm init -w` to initialize the workspace. Add necessary scripts to the root `package.json` for building and testing all packages. Install typescript, ts-node, and concurrently as dev dependencies.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the directory structure and build process. Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm build` to ensure no errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Monorepo Workspace [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial workspace using a tool like npm, yarn, or pnpm. This involves creating a package.json at the root and setting up the workspace configuration.
### Details:
Use `npm init -y` or equivalent to create the root package.json. Configure workspaces in package.json or a dedicated config file (e.g., pnpm-workspace.yaml).

## 2. Create Package Directories [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the individual package directories within the monorepo (e.g., packages/package-a, packages/package-b). Each directory will contain a separate package.
### Details:
Create directories under the designated packages directory (e.g., 'packages'). Add a package.json file to each package directory.

## 3. Configure TypeScript in Packages [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up TypeScript for each package. This includes installing TypeScript, creating tsconfig.json files, and configuring compiler options.
### Details:
Install TypeScript as a dev dependency in each package. Create a tsconfig.json file in each package, extending from a base config if desired. Configure compiler options as needed.

## 4. Add Build and Test Scripts [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Add build and test scripts to each package's package.json. These scripts will be used to build and test the code in each package.
### Details:
Add 'build' and 'test' scripts to the package.json of each package. The 'build' script should compile the TypeScript code. The 'test' script should run the tests using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
