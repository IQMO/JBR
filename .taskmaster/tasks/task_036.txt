# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Production-Ready Bot Lifecycle Management System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 10, 14, 15, 28, 46
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a production-ready bot lifecycle management system to handle bot initialization, strategy loading, signal processing, trade execution, monitoring, error handling, graceful shutdown, and state persistence. Ensure bots can run continuously in production with proper recovery mechanisms. Core bot lifecycle management is now complete and production-ready.
# Details:
1. Implement bot initialization routines, including loading configurations from the database (Task 15) and setting up initial state.
2. Develop strategy loading mechanisms to dynamically load and switch trading strategies.
3. Integrate signal processing logic to interpret market signals and generate trading decisions.
4. Implement trade execution logic using the exchange abstraction layer (Task 10) to place orders on different exchanges.
5. Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track bot performance, resource usage, and potential errors. Monitoring components have been moved to Task #46.
6. Develop robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent bot crashes.
7. Implement graceful shutdown procedures to ensure bots can be stopped and restarted without data loss.
8. Implement state persistence mechanisms to save and restore bot state, allowing bots to recover from unexpected shutdowns.
9. Integrate with the authentication system (Task 3) to ensure secure access to bot management functions.
10. Ensure the system is compatible with the trading engine core (Task 14) and the bot management dashboard UI (Task 28).
11. Implement automated recovery mechanisms to automatically restart bots after failures.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that bots can be initialized correctly with different configurations.
2. Test strategy loading and switching to ensure that bots can dynamically adapt to changing market conditions.
3. Verify that signal processing logic generates correct trading decisions based on market signals.
4. Test trade execution logic by placing orders on different exchanges and verifying that orders are executed correctly.
5. Verify that monitoring and logging mechanisms provide comprehensive information about bot performance and potential errors. Monitoring tests are now part of Task #46.
6. Test error handling mechanisms by simulating different error scenarios and verifying that bots can gracefully handle exceptions.
7. Test graceful shutdown procedures by stopping and restarting bots and verifying that no data is lost.
8. Test state persistence mechanisms by simulating unexpected shutdowns and verifying that bots can recover from the last saved state.
9. Verify that automated recovery mechanisms can automatically restart bots after failures.
10. Monitor bot performance in a production environment to ensure that bots can run continuously without issues.

# Subtasks:

### Dependencies: 36.5
### Description: Move the monitoring components (36.5.1-36.5.5) to Task #46 for better organization.
### Details:
Remove the subtasks related to monitoring from this task and add them to Task #46.

## 1. Implement Bot Initialization and Configuration Loading [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the bot initialization routine, focusing on loading bot configurations from the database (building upon Task 15) and setting up the initial bot state. This includes fetching API keys, strategy parameters, and other necessary settings.

## 2. Develop Dynamic Strategy Loading Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a mechanism to dynamically load and switch trading strategies at runtime. This should allow for updating strategies without restarting the bot.
### Details:
Implement a strategy loader that can load strategy code from a specified location (e.g., a file system or database). Use a modular design to allow for easy addition and removal of strategies. Implement versioning for strategies to track changes and allow for rollback. Ensure that the strategy loading process is secure and prevents malicious code from being executed.
<info added on 2025-07-03T11:28:50.137Z>
**Analysis of Current Strategy Loading System:**

**Current Implementation:**
1. **Static Strategy Loading**: The `BotManager.loadStrategy()` method uses hardcoded switch statements to load strategies
2. **Limited Flexibility**: Strategies are imported statically using dynamic imports, but selection is fixed
3. **Plugin System Exists**: There's a sophisticated `StrategyPluginManager` with security validation, but it's not integrated with the bot runtime
4. **Strategy Factory Available**: A `StrategyFactory` exists that can work with the plugin manager

**Key Issues to Address:**
1. **No Runtime Strategy Switching**: Cannot change strategies without restarting the bot
2. **Hardcoded Strategy Selection**: Strategy types are limited to predefined cases
3. **Missing Integration**: Plugin manager and strategy factory are not used by the bot runtime
4. **No Versioning Support**: No mechanism to track or rollback strategy versions
5. **Configuration Validation**: Limited validation of strategy configurations during loading

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create a `DynamicStrategyLoader` that integrates the existing `StrategyPluginManager` and `StrategyFactory`
2. Implement hot-swapping capabilities to change strategies without stopping bots
3. Add strategy versioning and rollback mechanisms
4. Integrate comprehensive configuration validation
5. Add strategy performance monitoring and automatic fallback
6. Update the `BotRuntime` to support dynamic strategy switching
7. Create API endpoints for runtime strategy management

Ensure that the signal processing logic is efficient and can handle high-frequency data.
