# Task ID: 60
# Title: Fix API Service TypeScript Violations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 39, 50, 54
# Priority: high
# Description: Address TypeScript violations in the API service by replacing 'any' types with proper interfaces and adding curly braces around if statements to improve code quality and maintainability.
# Details:
1. **Analyze API Service Code:** Review the API service code to identify instances where 'any' types are used and where 'if' statements lack curly braces.
2. **Define TypeScript Interfaces:** Based on the backend response types, create accurate TypeScript interfaces to replace the 'any' types. Ensure the interfaces accurately reflect the structure and data types of the API responses.
3. **Implement Type Replacements:** Replace all instances of 'any' with the newly defined TypeScript interfaces. This will improve type safety and reduce the risk of runtime errors.
4. **Add Curly Braces to 'if' Statements:** Add curly braces to all 'if' statements that are currently missing them. This will improve code readability and prevent potential errors.
5. **Code Review:** Conduct a thorough code review to ensure that all 'any' types have been replaced and all 'if' statements have curly braces.

# Test Strategy:
1. **TypeScript Compilation:** Run the TypeScript compiler to ensure that there are no type errors after replacing 'any' types with interfaces and adding curly braces.
2. **Unit Tests:** Write and run unit tests to verify that the API service functions correctly with the new TypeScript interfaces and that the 'if' statements behave as expected.
3. **Integration Tests:** Perform integration tests to ensure that the API service interacts correctly with other parts of the system after the changes.
4. **Manual Testing:** Manually test the API endpoints to verify that the responses are as expected and that there are no runtime errors.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Backend Response Types and Existing Interfaces [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Examine the backend API documentation and existing TypeScript interfaces to understand the structure and data types of all API responses. Identify areas where current interfaces are missing or incomplete.
### Details:
1. Access the backend API documentation (e.g., Swagger, Postman collection). 2. Review existing TypeScript interface definitions in the API service. 3. Document discrepancies between the backend responses and the current interfaces. 4. Identify all instances where 'any' is currently used.

**TypeScript 'any' violations:**
- Line 287: `Promise<ApiResponse<any[]>>` for getAlerts return type
- Line 301: `Promise<ApiResponse<any>>` for acknowledgeAlert
- Line 307: `Promise<ApiResponse<any>>` for resolveAlert  
- Line 325: `Promise<ApiResponse<any[]>>` for getLogs
- Lines 289-296: Missing curly braces on multiple if statements
- Lines 327-337: Missing curly braces on multiple if statements

**Available shared types:**
- LogEntry interface exists in @jabbr/shared/src/types.ts
- Alert interface exists in backend alert-manager.service.ts but not exported from shared
- Need to create Alert interface in shared types

**Backend API structure analysis:**
- Alert responses match backend Alert interface structure
- Log responses match shared LogEntry interface
- ApiResponse<T> generic wrapper used consistently

## 2. Define or Update TypeScript Interfaces [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create new TypeScript interfaces or update existing ones to accurately reflect the structure and data types of the backend API responses. Ensure all properties are correctly typed and that optional properties are marked appropriately.
### Details:
1. Create new `.ts` files for new interfaces, or modify existing ones. 2. Use TypeScript syntax to define interfaces with appropriate property types (string, number, boolean, array, object, etc.). 3. Use optional properties (`?`) where appropriate. 4. Consider using utility types like `Partial`, `Readonly`, or `Pick` to create more specific interfaces based on existing ones.

Alert interface added to shared types:

**Changes made:**
1. Added Alert interface to packages/shared/src/types.ts based on backend definition
2. Exported Alert interface from packages/shared/src/index.ts
3. Interface includes all necessary properties: id, type, category, level, title, message, source, etc.
4. Maintains compatibility with backend Alert interface structure
5. Ready to replace 'any' types in API service

**Interface properties:**
- Complete type definitions for all alert fields
- Optional fields properly marked (value?, threshold?, acknowledgedBy?, etc.)
- Matches backend AlertManagerService.Alert interface exactly

## 3. Replace 'any' Types with Defined Interfaces [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Replace all instances of 'any' in the API service code with the newly defined or updated TypeScript interfaces. This includes function parameters, return types, and variable declarations.
### Details:
1. Use a code editor's find and replace functionality to locate all instances of 'any'. 2. Replace 'any' with the appropriate TypeScript interface name. 3. Ensure that the code compiles without type errors after the replacements.
<info added on 2025-07-05T19:50:24.311Z>
Replaced all 'any' types with proper interfaces.

**Changes made:**
1. Added imports for Alert and LogEntry from @jabbr/shared/src
2. Replaced `Promise<ApiResponse<any[]>>` in getAlerts with `Promise<ApiResponse<Alert[]>>`
3. Replaced `Promise<ApiResponse<any>>` in acknowledgeAlert with `Promise<ApiResponse<Alert>>`
4. Replaced `Promise<ApiResponse<any>>` in resolveAlert with `Promise<ApiResponse<Alert>>`
5. Replaced `Promise<ApiResponse<any[]>>` in getLogs with `Promise<ApiResponse<LogEntry[]>>`

**Verification:**
- ESLint check shows no more @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any errors
- All API methods now have proper type safety
- Ready to fix curly braces in next subtask

## 4. Add Curly Braces to 'if' Statements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add curly braces `{}` to all 'if' statements in the API service code that are currently missing them. This will improve code readability and prevent potential errors related to scope.
### Details:
1. Use a code editor's search functionality to find all 'if' statements without curly braces (e.g., `if (condition)
  statement;`). 2. Add curly braces around the statement(s) within the 'if' block (e.g., `if (condition) {
  statement;
}`). 3. Ensure that the code's functionality remains unchanged after adding the curly braces.
<info added on 2025-07-05T19:52:28.428Z>
**Changes made:**
1. Fixed import order by adding blank line between import groups
2. Added curly braces to all if statements in getAlerts method (7 statements)
3. Added curly braces to all if statements in getLogs method (10 statements)
4. All statements now follow proper code formatting standards

**Verification:**
- ESLint check shows no more curly brace violations
- ESLint check shows no other code style issues
- Code readability significantly improved
- All if statements now properly scoped with braces
</info added on 2025-07-05T19:52:28.428Z>

## 5. Validate TypeScript Compilation and Conduct Code Review [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run the TypeScript compiler to ensure that there are no compilation errors. Conduct a thorough code review to verify that all 'any' types have been replaced, all 'if' statements have curly braces, and the code adheres to coding standards.
### Details:
1. Run `tsc` to check for TypeScript compilation errors. 2. Address any compilation errors that arise. 3. Conduct a code review with another developer to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards. 4. Verify that all changes are properly documented.
