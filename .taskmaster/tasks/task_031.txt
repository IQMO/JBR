# Task ID: 31
# Title: Create Frontend UI for Aether Signal Configuration and Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20, 29, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a user interface for configuring and monitoring the Aether Signal Generator, including parameter adjustments, signal output visualization, and monitoring of advanced mathematical models.
# Details:
1.  Create a new UI module within the existing React/Next.js frontend (Task 20). 
2.  Design UI components for configuring Aether Signal parameters, allowing users to adjust settings related to Fractional PDE, Reflected BSDE, Mean-Field Games, and Malliavin Calculus.
3.  Implement real-time signal output visualization using charts and graphs, displaying the generated signals and their characteristics.
4.  Integrate with the Aether Signal Generator (Task 29) to fetch and display the outputs of the advanced mathematical models.
5.  Implement monitoring tools to track the performance and behavior of the Aether Signal Generator, providing insights into its effectiveness.
6.  Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly, providing clear feedback and intuitive controls.
7.  Consider using a charting library like Chart.js or Recharts for signal visualization.
8.  Implement error handling and validation to prevent invalid configurations and provide informative error messages.
9.  Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that the UI components for configuring Aether Signal parameters are functioning correctly and allow users to adjust settings.
2.  Test the real-time signal output visualization by generating signals and verifying that they are displayed accurately in the UI.
3.  Verify that the monitoring tools provide accurate and relevant information about the performance and behavior of the Aether Signal Generator.
4.  Test the UI with different configurations and scenarios to ensure it handles various situations correctly.
5.  Verify that error handling and validation are working as expected, preventing invalid configurations and providing informative error messages.
6.  Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly on different devices and screen sizes.
7.  Simulate live trading conditions and verify that the Aether Signal Generator is generating signals and the UI is displaying them correctly.
