# Task ID: 47
# Title: Address Code Duplication Issues from Code Quality Audit
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 41
# Priority: medium
# Description: Address code duplication issues identified in the code quality audit, focusing on eliminating actual duplication violations and resolving analyzer false positives.
# Details:
1.  Review the code quality audit report (Task 41) to understand the identified code duplication issues.
2.  Verify that the previously addressed code duplication issues are indeed resolved and no new instances have emerged.
3.  Investigate the analyzer's false positive detections and implement necessary configurations or code adjustments to prevent future occurrences.
4.  Document the steps taken to resolve the code duplication issues and update the code quality audit report accordingly.
5.  Ensure that the shared utilities and consolidated interfaces created in the previous effort are properly utilized and maintained.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Run static analysis tools to confirm that no code duplication violations are detected.
2.  Manually review the codebase to verify that the identified code duplication issues have been resolved and no new instances have emerged.
3.  Validate that the analyzer's false positive detections are no longer occurring.
4.  Verify that the shared utilities and consolidated interfaces are functioning correctly and are being utilized effectively.
5.  Confirm that the code quality audit report has been updated with the resolution details.
