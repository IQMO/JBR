# Task ID: 62
# Title: Handle Console Statements in Context Files
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 43, 51, 60, 61
# Priority: medium
# Description: Address console statements in context files (ConnectionStatus.tsx, WebSocketContext.tsx, useWebSocket.ts) by removing them or wrapping them in development environment guards, after verifying backend logging requirements.
# Details:
1. **Review Backend Logging Requirements:** Consult with the backend team or documentation to understand the necessary logging levels and types required for production and development environments.
2. **Identify Console Statements:** Search for all `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`, and `console.debug` statements within the specified context files (ConnectionStatus.tsx, WebSocketContext.tsx, useWebSocket.ts).
3. **Implement Environment Guards:** Wrap console statements with environment checks to ensure they are only executed in development environments. Use environment variables (e.g., `NODE_ENV === 'development'`) to control the execution of these statements. Example:
   ```typescript
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
     console.log('Debug message');
   }
   ```
4. **Remove Unnecessary Statements:** Remove any console statements that are deemed unnecessary or redundant, especially those that duplicate backend logging.
5. **Refactor Logging:** If necessary, refactor existing console statements to use a more structured logging approach (e.g., using a logging library like Winston) that can be configured based on the environment.
6. **Update Context Files:** Apply the changes to ConnectionStatus.tsx, WebSocketContext.tsx, and useWebSocket.ts.
7. **Code Review:** Submit the changes for code review, ensuring that the implemented environment guards and logging changes align with project standards.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Verify Console Output in Development:** In a development environment, verify that the console statements are executed and display the expected output.
2. **Verify No Console Output in Production:** In a production environment, verify that the console statements are not executed and do not produce any output in the browser's console.
3. **Check Logging Functionality:** Ensure that the backend logging system is functioning correctly and capturing the necessary information, even after removing or modifying console statements.
4. **Run Unit Tests:** Execute unit tests to ensure that the changes in the context files do not introduce any regressions or unexpected behavior.
5. **Manual Testing:** Manually test the components that use the context files to ensure that they are functioning as expected and that no critical information is lost due to the removal or modification of console statements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Backend Logging Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Consult backend documentation and/or communicate with the backend team to understand the required logging levels and types for different environments (development, staging, production). Document the findings, focusing on what information the backend already logs and what, if anything, needs to be logged on the frontend.
### Details:
1. Identify relevant backend logging documentation or contacts.
2. Determine the logging levels used by the backend (e.g., debug, info, warn, error).
3. Understand the types of events/data logged by the backend.
4. Document the findings in a clear and concise manner, highlighting any gaps that need to be addressed on the frontend.
5. Consider using a table to summarize the backend logging configuration.

## 2. Identify and Categorize Console Statements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Search for all instances of `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`, and `console.debug` within `ConnectionStatus.tsx`, `WebSocketContext.tsx`, and `useWebSocket.ts`. Categorize each statement based on its purpose (e.g., debugging, error reporting, informational) and its relevance in a production environment.
### Details:
1. Use a code editor's search functionality to find all console statements in the specified files.
2. Create a spreadsheet or similar document to list each console statement, its location (file and line number), its purpose, and its relevance in production.
3. Classify each statement as either 'Keep in Development Only', 'Remove', or 'Refactor'.

## 3. Implement Environment Guards and Remove Unnecessary Statements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Based on the categorization from the previous step, implement environment guards around console statements that should only be executed in development environments. Remove console statements that are deemed unnecessary or redundant. Apply changes to `ConnectionStatus.tsx`, `WebSocketContext.tsx`, and `useWebSocket.ts`.
### Details:
1. For statements categorized as 'Keep in Development Only', wrap them in an `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') { ... }` block.
2. For statements categorized as 'Remove', delete them from the code.
3. Ensure that the environment variable `NODE_ENV` is correctly configured in the development environment.
4. Commit changes to the specified files.

## 4. Refactor Logging and Submit for Code Review [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor any console statements categorized as 'Refactor' to use a more structured logging approach if necessary. Ensure that all changes align with project standards and submit the updated code for review.
### Details:
1. If a structured logging approach is required, choose a suitable logging library (e.g., Winston) and integrate it into the project.
2. Refactor the identified console statements to use the chosen logging library.
3. Ensure that the logging configuration is environment-aware.
4. Submit the changes for code review, highlighting the implemented environment guards, removed statements, and refactored logging.
