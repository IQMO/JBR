# Task ID: 3
# Title: Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a basic authentication system using JWT.
# Details:
Create authentication endpoints (/auth/login, /auth/register) in the backend. Use bcrypt for password hashing and jsonwebtoken for token generation. Store user credentials in PostgreSQL. Implement middleware to protect routes that require authentication. Use `pnpm add bcrypt jsonwebtoken @types/jsonwebtoken`. Ensure the authentication system integrates seamlessly with the trading engine and bot management components.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration, login, and authentication middleware. Ensure tokens are correctly generated and validated. Verify that authenticated users can access trading engine functionalities and manage their bots.
