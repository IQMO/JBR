# Task ID: 29
# Title: Integrate Aether Signal Generator with Bot Trading System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15, 17, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the Aether Signal Generator with the bot trading system, strategy framework, and trading engine for live trading.
# Details:
1. Instantiate the AetherSignalGenerator class within the bot trading system.
2. Modify the strategy framework (Task 17) to accept signals from the AetherSignalGenerator.
3. Implement signal processing logic to translate Aether signals into trading orders.
4. Integrate the signal processing logic with the trading engine to execute trades based on Aether signals.
5. Configure the bot management system (Task 15) to allow users to select and configure the Aether Signal Generator as a trading strategy.

# Test Strategy:
1. Configure a trading bot to use the Aether Signal Generator strategy.
2. Simulate live trading conditions and verify that the bot executes trades based on Aether signals.
3. Monitor the bot's performance and P&L to ensure that the Aether signals are generating profitable trades.
4. Test different Aether signal configurations to optimize trading performance.
5. Verify that the bot management system correctly displays the status and performance of bots using Aether signals.
6. Test error handling and logging to ensure that any issues with the Aether Signal Generator integration are properly reported.
