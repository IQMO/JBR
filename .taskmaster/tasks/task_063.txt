# Task ID: 63
# Title: Verify Frontend-Backend Integration Alignment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 4, 6, 21, 23, 27, 29, 42, 46, 51
# Priority: high
# Description: Verify the alignment between the frontend and backend by thoroughly testing all API endpoints, WebSocket channels, and data structures against the actual backend implementation to ensure seamless integration.
# Details:
1.  **API Endpoint Validation:**
    *   Test all REST API endpoints to ensure they return the correct data structures and status codes.
    *   Verify request and response payloads against the defined schemas.
    *   Check for proper error handling and informative error messages.
2.  **WebSocket Channel Verification:**
    *   Establish WebSocket connections and verify the data flow in both directions.
    *   Ensure real-time data updates are correctly transmitted and received.
    *   Test different message types and data formats.
3.  **Data Structure Alignment:**
    *   Validate that the data structures used in the frontend match those used in the backend.
    *   Check for data type mismatches, missing fields, or incorrect data formatting.
    *   Ensure data integrity and consistency across the system.
4.  **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**
    *   Test error handling mechanisms to ensure they function correctly.
    *   Simulate edge cases and boundary conditions to identify potential issues.
    *   Verify that the system gracefully handles unexpected inputs or errors.
5.  **Documentation Review:**
    *   Review API documentation and WebSocket documentation to ensure they accurately reflect the current implementation.
    *   Update documentation as needed to reflect any changes or updates.
6.  **Performance Testing:**
    *   Conduct performance tests to ensure the integration can handle the expected load.
    *   Identify and address any performance bottlenecks.
7.  **Security Testing:**
    *   Perform security tests to identify and address any potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   Ensure that all data is properly secured and protected.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **API Endpoint Testing:**
    *   Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to send requests to all API endpoints and verify the responses.
    *   Automate API testing using tools like Jest or Mocha.
2.  **WebSocket Channel Testing:**
    *   Use a WebSocket client to connect to the server and send/receive messages.
    *   Verify that real-time data updates are correctly displayed in the UI.
    *   Automate WebSocket testing using tools like Socket.IO client.
3.  **Data Structure Validation:**
    *   Write unit tests to validate the data structures used in the frontend and backend.
    *   Use TypeScript interfaces to enforce data type consistency.
4.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   Write integration tests to verify the interaction between the frontend and backend.
    *   Simulate user interactions and verify that the system behaves as expected.
5.  **End-to-End Testing:**
    *   Perform end-to-end tests to verify the entire system from the user interface to the database.
    *   Use tools like Cypress or Selenium to automate end-to-end tests.
6.  **Regression Testing:**
    *   Run regression tests to ensure that new changes do not introduce any new issues.
    *   Automate regression testing to ensure that the system remains stable over time.

# Subtasks:
## 1. API Endpoint Audit and Schema Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Audit all REST API endpoints to ensure they align with the backend implementation. Verify request and response payloads against the defined backend schemas. Document any discrepancies found.
### Details:
1. Obtain a list of all API endpoints from the frontend code.
2. For each endpoint, identify the corresponding backend implementation.
3. Compare the expected request and response schemas (from frontend) with the actual schemas implemented in the backend.
4. Use tools like Swagger or Postman to send requests to the backend and validate the responses against the expected schemas.
5. Document any mismatches in a detailed report, including the endpoint, the expected schema, the actual schema, and the nature of the discrepancy.

## 2. WebSocket Channel Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test all WebSocket channels to ensure they function correctly and align with the backend channels. Verify data flow in both directions and test different message types and data formats.
### Details:
1. Identify all WebSocket channels used by the frontend.
2. For each channel, determine the corresponding backend channel.
3. Establish WebSocket connections using a tool like wscat or a custom script.
4. Send various message types and data formats through the channels.
5. Verify that the data is correctly transmitted and received by both the frontend and backend.
6. Document any issues with data flow, message types, or data formats.

## 3. Data Structure Matching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that the data structures used in the frontend match the data structures used in the backend. Check for data type mismatches, missing fields, or incorrect data formatting.
### Details:
1. Identify the data structures used by the frontend to represent data received from the backend.
2. Compare these data structures with the corresponding data structures used by the backend.
3. Pay close attention to data types, field names, and data formatting.
4. Use a tool like JSON Schema Validator to validate the data structures.
5. Document any mismatches or inconsistencies.

## 4. Component Integration Testing with Real Backend [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test the integration of frontend components with the real backend. Ensure that data is correctly displayed and that user interactions trigger the correct backend actions.
### Details:
1. Select a representative set of frontend components that interact with the backend.
2. Deploy the frontend to a test environment that connects to the real backend.
3. Manually test the selected components, focusing on data display and user interactions.
4. Verify that data is correctly displayed in the frontend.
5. Ensure that user interactions trigger the correct backend actions and that the frontend receives the expected responses.
6. Document any integration issues.

## 5. Documentation of Misalignments and Remediation Plan [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document any remaining misalignments between the frontend and backend. Create a remediation plan to address these misalignments.
### Details:
1. Consolidate all the misalignments identified in the previous subtasks into a single document.
2. For each misalignment, describe the issue, its impact, and the steps required to resolve it.
3. Prioritize the misalignments based on their severity and impact.
4. Create a remediation plan that outlines the steps required to address each misalignment, including the responsible parties and the estimated timeline.
5. Share the documentation and remediation plan with the development team.
