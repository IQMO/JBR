# Task ID: 27
# Title: Validate Production Environment Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Validate the production environment configuration by ensuring the backend starts correctly with the new settings and that both the frontend and backend recognize the production mode.
# Details:
1.  Ensure all necessary environment variables are set correctly on the production server, specifically focusing on those required for backend startup.
2.  Update the backend configuration to use the production Bybit API keys (BYBIT_TESTNET=false). Ensure the keys are securely stored and accessed via environment variables.
3.  Modify the backend code to correctly identify and operate in production mode by checking environment variables.
4.  Verify that the trading engine is using the correct exchange adapters and authentication credentials for production by inspecting the loaded environment variables.
5.  Implement logging to confirm the system's environment mode upon startup.


# Test Strategy:
1.  Start the backend with the production configuration and verify that it starts without errors.
2.  Check the backend logs to confirm that it is running in production mode and using the correct API keys (verify keys are not testnet).
3.  Simulate a connection from the frontend to the backend and verify that the environment status is correctly identified.
4.  Check the logs for any errors or warnings during startup and address them accordingly.
