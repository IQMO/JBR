# Task ID: 17
# Title: Strategy Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a strategy framework with a pluggable architecture.
# Details:
Implement a strategy framework with a pluggable architecture. The framework allows users to plug in custom strategies and includes basic signal processing (simple moving averages). The strategy framework is flexible and allows users to easily plug in custom trading strategies.

   - SMA signal processor implemented with configurable parameters
   - Type-safe signal generation and processing
   - Fully tested with various market conditions

4. **Testing Framework**
   - Complete backtesting system with market data simulation
   - Performance metrics calculation and position management
   - Example scripts for parameter optimization

5. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive documentation for all components
   - Developer guides for creating custom strategies

- Optimize strategy parameters
- Monitor strategy performance

All components are ...

# Test Strategy:
Test the strategy framework by plugging in different strategies and verifying that they generate correct signals. Verify that users can easily plug in custom trading strategies and that they generate correct signals.

# Subtasks:
## 5. Finalize Strategy Framework Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Finalize the strategy framework implementation, ensuring all components are production-ready and well-documented.
### Details:
This includes reviewing code, updating documentation, and addressing any remaining issues identified during testing. Ensure the SMA signal processor, backtesting, and integration tests are implemented, documented, and production-ready. Documentation and code should reflect the final, production-ready state.
<info added on 2025-07-03T00:07:02.749Z>
Completed the following components for the strategy framework finalization:

1. Backtesting framework implementation:
   - Created a comprehensive backtesting system for trading strategies
   - Added market data simulation with realistic price behavior
   - Implemented position management and trade execution simulation
   - Added performance metrics calculation
   - Fixed all TypeScript errors and ensured type safety

2. Documentation:
   - Created detailed documentation for the strategy backtesting framework
   - Included usage examples, configuration options, and advanced usage patterns
   - Documented all performance metrics and their significance

3. Example implementation:
   - Created an example script demonstrating parameter optimization
   - Implemented historical data handling with caching
   - Added mock data generation for testing purposes

The backtesting framework now allows users to:
- Test strategies against historical data
- Optimize strategy parameters
- Calculate comprehensive performance metrics
- Generate equity curves and trade histories
- Apply realistic trading conditions (fees, slippage)

All implemented code is type-safe, well-documented, and follows project conventions.

## 1. Define Trading Strategy Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define a clear and concise interface that all trading strategies must implement. This interface should include methods for receiving market data, generating trading signals, and managing positions.
### Details:
Specify input data format, output signal format, and error handling mechanisms.

âœ… COMPLETED: Comprehensive Trading Strategy Interface Implementation

ðŸŽ¯ **What Was Accomplished:**
- Created complete unified strategy interface at `packages/backend/src/strategies/interfaces.ts`
- Defined core `IStrategy` interface with lifecycle methods (initialize, execute, cleanup)
- Implemented comprehensive configuration system with validation and schema support
- Built modular provider system for market data, risk management, position management, logging, storage, and events
- Created robust signal generation system with confidence scoring and risk levels
- Added strategy factory and registry system for plugin architecture

ðŸ“‹ **Key Interfaces Created:**
- `IStrategy` - Main strategy contract with 15+ methods
- `StrategyContext` - Rich execution context with 11 providers
- `TradingSignal` - Comprehensive signal structure with confidence, strength, and risk levels
- `StrategyConfig` - Complete configuration with risk management and execution settings
- `StrategyState` - Detailed state tracking with performance metrics
- Provider interfaces: MarketDataProvider, RiskManagerProvider, PositionManagerProvider, etc.
- `IStrategyFactory` - Plugin system for dynamic strategy loading

ðŸ”§ **Technical Features:**
- Type-safe with full TypeScript support
- Modular provider architecture for easy testing and swapping
- Configuration validation with errors and warnings
- Dynamic UI schema generation for frontend integration
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Risk management integration at strategy level
- Performance tracking and state management

ðŸš€ **Ready for Next Steps:**
This interface provides the foundation for implementing actual trading strategies (SMA, EMA, custom scripts) and the plugin mechanism. All strategies will implement this unified interface ensuring consistency and modula...

## 2. Implement Custom Strategy Plugin Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop a mechanism that allows users to easily plug in their own custom trading strategies that conform to the defined interface. This may involve using plugins, configuration files, or other methods.
### Details:
Consider security implications and version control for custom strategies.
