# Strategy Framework Status (as of July 3, 2025)

## Overview

The strategy framework is now production-ready, with all core components
implemented, tested, and documented. The system supports pluggable custom
strategies, robust signal processing (SMA/EMA), and a full plugin mechanism.

## Key Milestones

- **Unified Strategy Interface**: Complete, type-safe, and used throughout the
  codebase
- **Plugin System**: Fully implemented with security, validation, and
  hot-reloading
- **SMA Signal Processor**: Production-ready, with backtesting and integration
  tests
- **Example Plugin**: Demonstrates custom strategy integration
- **Documentation**: All major components are documented, including usage and
  configuration

## Task Master Task Status

- **17.3 Implement Basic Signal Processing (SMA)**: ✅ Done
- **17.4 Test the Strategy Framework**: ✅ Done
- **All subtasks for Task 17**: Complete except for final review/cleanup

## Next Steps

- Finalize documentation and review for completeness
- Continue to expand plugin library and add more example strategies
- Monitor for edge cases and user feedback
