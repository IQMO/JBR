# Task ID: 44
# Title: Clean Up Legacy Files and Update Documentation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 43, 42, 41
# Priority: medium
# Description: Clean up legacy files and update documentation references after successful environment unification. This includes removing redundant files and updating documentation to reflect the new unified environment configuration.
# Details:
1. **Identify and Remove Redundant Files:**
   - Locate and delete all `env.example` files that are no longer needed due to the unified `.env` at the project root. Pay special attention to package-specific directories (e.g., `packages/backend`, `packages/frontend`, `packages/shared`).
   - Remove any outdated debug scripts or configuration files that are no longer relevant after the environment unification.
2. **Update Documentation:**
   - Review all project documentation (e.g., README files, setup guides, internal documentation) and update references to the new unified environment configuration structure.
   - Ensure that the documentation clearly explains how to set up and use the `.env` file at the project root.
   - Update any examples or tutorials that demonstrate environment variable usage to reflect the new configuration.
3. **Verify Changes:**
   - After removing files and updating documentation, thoroughly test the application to ensure that it still functions correctly.
   - Check that all environment variables are being loaded correctly from the unified `.env` file.
   - Ensure that the updated documentation accurately reflects the current state of the project.

LEGACY FILE CLEANUP COMPLETED

ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. Removed `packages/backend/env.example` - redundant with root `.env.example`
2. Cleaned up Next.js webpack cache `.old` files - automatically regenerated
3. Updated `PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md` to reference root `.env.example` instead of backend package
4. Updated `CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md` to reflect unified environment configuration

DOCUMENTATION UPDATES:
- All references now point to root-level `.env` and `.env.example`
- Removed outdated package-specific environment file references
- Updated environment loading instructions to reflect unified approach

REMAINING DEBUG SCRIPTS:
The debug scripts in `packages/backend/scripts/debug/` are being kept for now as they may still be useful for development and troubleshooting SMA strategy issues. They can be removed later if truly no longer needed.

The project now has a clean, unified environment configuration structure with proper documentation.

# Test Strategy:
1. **File Removal Verification:**
   - Manually verify that all identified redundant files (e.g., `env.example` in package directories, outdated debug scripts) have been successfully removed.
   - Use file system commands (e.g., `ls`, `find`) to confirm the absence of these files.
2. **Documentation Accuracy:**
   - Review all updated documentation to ensure that it accurately describes the new unified environment configuration.
   - Follow the documentation to set up the project and verify that all steps are clear and correct.
3. **Application Functionality:**
   - Run all existing tests (unit, integration, e2e) to ensure that the application functions correctly after the file removal and documentation updates.
   - Manually test key features of the application to verify that environment variables are being loaded correctly and that the application behaves as expected in different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
4. **Environment Variable Loading:**
   - Create a test script that specifically checks if all required environment variables are loaded correctly from the root `.env` file.
   - Verify that the application can access these variables and use them to configure its behavior.
