# Task ID: 32
# Title: Create Frontend UI for Target Reacher Configuration and Monitoring
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 20, 15, 19, 28, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a user interface for configuring and monitoring the Target Reacher bot, allowing users to set parameters, monitor performance, and visualize results.
# Details:
1.  Create a new UI module within the existing React/Next.js frontend (Task 20).
2.  Design UI components for configuring Target Reacher parameters, including target prices, percentages, risk management settings, and aggressiveness levels. Use appropriate input types and validation.
3.  Implement real-time monitoring of target achievement using charts and graphs, displaying progress towards targets and key performance indicators.
4.  Integrate with the Target Reacher backend (when available) to fetch and display performance data and allow users to adjust parameters dynamically.
5.  Incorporate risk management settings configuration, linking to the per-bot risk management UI (Task 19) and overall bot management dashboard (Task 28).
6.  Implement modular target reacher performance visualization, allowing users to select and view different performance metrics and timeframes.
7.  Consider incorporating elements from the Aether Signal UI (Task 31) for signal visualization and parameter adjustment, if applicable.
8.  Ensure the UI is responsive and user-friendly, providing clear feedback and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that the UI components for configuring Target Reacher parameters are functioning correctly and allow users to adjust settings.
2.  Test the real-time monitoring of target achievement by simulating trades and verifying that the data is displayed accurately in the UI.
3.  Verify that the risk management settings configuration is integrated correctly with the per-bot risk management UI (Task 19).
4.  Test the modular target reacher performance visualization by selecting different metrics and timeframes and verifying that the data is displayed correctly.
5.  Ensure that the UI is responsive and user-friendly, providing clear feedback and error handling.
