# Task ID: 6
# Title: Time Synchronization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement time synchronization module with NTP integration.
# Details:
Use an NTP client library (e.g., 'ntp-client') to fetch time from NTP servers. Implement a WebSocket channel (/ws/time-sync) to send time updates to the client. Calculate and compensate for time drift. Use `pnpm add ntp-client`. Ensure accurate time synchronization for the trading engine's order execution and risk management components.

# Test Strategy:
Test time synchronization accuracy. Ensure the client receives time updates and compensates for drift. Verify that the trading engine's order execution and risk management components are using the synchronized time.
