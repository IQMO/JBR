# Task ID: 37
# Title: Create Comprehensive System Integration Testing Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 14, 15, 28, 31, 32, 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive system integration testing suite to validate the complete bot trading flow, ensuring all components work together correctly in production scenarios.
# Details:
1.  Design and implement end-to-end tests that cover the entire bot trading flow, including indicator calculations, signal generation, strategy execution, order placement, position management, risk controls, and WebSocket updates.
2.  Utilize a testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to create automated tests.
3.  Simulate realistic market conditions and trading scenarios to thoroughly test the system's behavior.
4.  Integrate the testing suite with the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous testing and validation.
5.  Implement comprehensive logging and reporting to facilitate debugging and analysis of test results.
6.  Ensure tests cover edge cases and error handling scenarios.
7.  Use mock data and services where appropriate to isolate components and improve test performance.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Execute the entire system integration testing suite and verify that all tests pass.
2.  Analyze test results to identify any failures or errors.
3.  Investigate and fix any identified issues, and re-run the tests to ensure they are resolved.
4.  Monitor system performance during testing to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues.
5.  Verify that all components of the bot trading flow are functioning correctly and interacting seamlessly.
6.  Validate that the system can handle realistic trading volumes and market volatility.
7.  Confirm that risk controls are functioning correctly and preventing excessive losses.
8.  Verify that WebSocket updates are being received and processed correctly.
9.  Ensure that the system is robust and can handle unexpected errors or failures.
