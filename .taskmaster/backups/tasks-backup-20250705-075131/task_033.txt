# Test Strategy:
1.  Verify that all indicators in the JabbrLabs/indicators directory have comprehensive documentation, including descriptions, parameters, and usage examples.
2.  Test the standardized interfaces for all indicators, ensuring consistent input and output formats.
3.  Run unit tests to validate the calculations of all indicators, comparing the output with known correct values.
4.  Test the unified export system by importing and using indicators in different strategies and signals.
5.  Verify that the indicators library is compatible with the trading engine and bot management components.
6.  Test the indicators with different data sets and market conditions to ensure robustness and reliability.
7.  Measure the performance of the indicators to ensure they are efficient and do not introduce significant overhead.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Standard Indicator Interface and Base Class [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define a standard interface or abstract base class for all indicators. This interface should specify the required input parameters (e.g., price data, period) and the expected output format (e.g., a single value, a tuple of values).
### Details:
Create an `Indicator` interface or abstract class with methods like `calculate(data: Series, period: int, ...)` and properties for accessing metadata (name, description, parameters). Ensure type safety using appropriate type hints. This will serve as the foundation for standardization.

## 2. Implement Unified Export System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a single entry point for importing indicators. This will involve creating an `index.ts` (or equivalent) file that exports all available indicators. This simplifies usage and reduces the risk of naming conflicts.
### Details:
Create an `index.ts` file that imports all indicator classes and re-exports them under a single namespace or as individual exports. For example: `export { SMA } from './sma'; export { EMA } from './ema';`. Consider using a factory pattern to instantiate indicators based on configuration.

## 3. Refactor Existing Indicators to Adhere to Standard Interface [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the existing indicator implementations (SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, ATR, etc.) to inherit from the defined base class or implement the standard interface. Ensure that all indicators accept the same input parameters and return the same output format as defined in the interface.
### Details:
Update each indicator class to extend the `Indicator` base class or implement the `Indicator` interface. Adjust the `calculate` method to match the defined signature. Ensure that the output format is consistent across all indicators. Pay close attention to type safety.
