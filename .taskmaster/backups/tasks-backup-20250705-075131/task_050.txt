# Task ID: 50
# Title: Complete JavaScript to TypeScript Migration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 39, 41
# Priority: medium
# Description: Convert all remaining JavaScript (.js) files in the project to TypeScript (.ts) while maintaining functionality, project structure, and production readiness, ensuring a 100% TypeScript codebase.
# Details:
1.  **File Conversion:**
    *   Rename each JavaScript file (.js) to its TypeScript equivalent (.ts).
    *   Thoroughly analyze each file before conversion to ensure accurate translation of logic and dependencies.
    *   Update file contents to adhere to TypeScript syntax and best practices.
2.  **Dependency Updates:**
    *   Update all internal imports and exports to reflect the new TypeScript file extensions.
    *   Ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved after the conversion.
3.  **Type Addition:**
    *   Add explicit types to variables, function parameters, and return values where necessary to improve code clarity and maintainability.
    *   Leverage TypeScript's type inference capabilities to minimize boilerplate.
4.  **Testing and Validation:**
    *   Run all existing unit and integration tests to ensure that the converted files maintain existing functionality.
    *   Address any compilation errors or runtime issues that arise during testing.
5.  **Exclusions:**
    *   Exclude build outputs (.next, dist, node_modules) from conversion.
    *   Exclude configuration files that must remain as JavaScript (.eslintrc.js, etc.).
    *   Exclude third-party generated files.
6.  **Folder Structure:**
    *   Respect backend, frontend, and shared folder structures during conversion.
7.  **Code Quality:**
    *   Ensure production-ready code quality by adhering to coding standards and best practices.
    *   Address any code quality issues identified during the conversion process.
8.  **Version Control:**
    *   Commit changes in small, logical increments to facilitate code review and rollback if necessary.
    *   Create a pull request for each converted file or group of related files.
9.  **Documentation:**
    *   Update any relevant documentation to reflect the changes made during the conversion process.

# Test Strategy:
1.  **Compilation Testing:**
    *   Run the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) to ensure that all converted files compile without errors.
    *   Address any compilation errors that arise during the compilation process.
2.  **Unit Testing:**
    *   Run all existing unit tests to ensure that the converted files maintain existing functionality.
    *   Write new unit tests to cover any new functionality or changes made during the conversion process.
3.  **Integration Testing:**
    *   Run all existing integration tests to ensure that the converted files integrate correctly with other parts of the system.
    *   Write new integration tests to cover any new integration points.
4.  **Runtime Testing:**
    *   Manually test the converted files in a runtime environment to ensure that they function as expected.
    *   Monitor the application for any runtime errors or performance issues.
5.  **Code Review:**
    *   Have the converted files reviewed by another developer to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.
    *   Address any feedback received during the code review process.
6.  **Regression Testing:**
    *   Perform regression testing to ensure that the conversion process has not introduced any new bugs or issues.
7.  **Performance Testing:**
    *   Conduct performance testing to ensure that the converted files do not negatively impact the performance of the application.
