# Task ID: 9
# Title: Redis Setup
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up Redis for caching.
# Details:
Install Redis and use a Node.js Redis client library (e.g., 'ioredis') to connect to the Redis server. Implement caching for frequently accessed data. Use `pnpm add ioredis`. Ensure Redis is used to cache frequently accessed data from the trading engine, such as position information and risk management parameters.

CODEBASE ANALYSIS UPDATE: Redis setup is NOT actually complete. The redis.service.ts file contains only 7 lines and is essentially a stub. No actual Redis connection, configuration, or usage implemented. Status corrected to "pending".

# Test Strategy:
Test Redis connection and caching functionality. Ensure data is correctly cached and retrieved from Redis. Verify that the trading engine is using Redis to cache frequently accessed data, such as position information and risk management parameters.
