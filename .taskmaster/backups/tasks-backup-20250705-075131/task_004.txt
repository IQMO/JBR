# Task ID: 4
# Title: WebSocket Server Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a WebSocket server using Node.js with 'ws' or 'socket.io'.
# Details:
Choose either 'ws' or 'socket.io' based on project needs. Implement WebSocket endpoints for market data, trading, bot status, and time sync. Handle connection management, message parsing, and error handling. Use `pnpm add ws` or `pnpm add socket.io`. Ensure the WebSocket server is robust and can handle the real-time data streams from the trading engine.

# Test Strategy:
Test WebSocket connection establishment, message sending, and error handling. Ensure the server can handle multiple concurrent connections. Verify that the server can stream market data, trading updates, and bot status information efficiently.
