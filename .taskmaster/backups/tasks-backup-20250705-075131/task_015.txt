# Test Strategy:
N/A - Full-stack bot management system implemented and tested. Verify that users can easily create and configure trading bots with different strategies and parameters, manage bot lifecycles, and track performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Bot Creation UI [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a user interface that allows users to create new bots by specifying a bot name and initial configuration.
### Details:
The UI should include input fields for bot name and a basic configuration template. Consider using a form with validation.

## 2. Implement Bot Configuration Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Develop the backend logic to allow users to configure bots with different trading strategies and parameters.
### Details:
This includes defining available strategies, parameters for each strategy, and validation rules. Implement the logic to apply these configurations to the bot.

## 3. Database Storage for Bot Configurations [done]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Design and implement a database schema to store bot configurations, including bot name, strategy, and parameters.
### Details:
Choose a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB). Define the schema and implement the necessary CRUD operations to store and retrieve bot configurations.

## 4. Develop Bot Management UI [done]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Create a user interface for managing existing bots, including viewing configurations, editing parameters, starting, and stopping bots.
### Details:
This UI should allow users to view a list of their bots, view and edit their configurations, and control their execution (start/stop).

## 5. Verify API Endpoint Security [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure all /api/bots endpoints are secured with JWT authentication.
### Details:
Test each endpoint to confirm that valid JWT tokens are required for access.

## 6. Validate Multi-Exchange Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test bot creation and execution across all supported exchanges (Bybit, Binance, OKX, Coinbase, Kraken).
### Details:
Create bots configured for each exchange and verify that they can connect and execute trades.

## 7. Confirm Risk Management Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Verify that stop loss, take profit, and position sizing features are correctly implemented and enforced.
### Details:
Create bots with different risk management configurations and monitor their behavior to ensure that stop loss and take profit orders are placed and executed correctly.

## 8. Implement Bot CRUD Operations in Backend [done]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Implement the backend API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting bots.
### Details:
Create the necessary API endpoints in the backend to handle bot management operations. This includes creating, reading, updating, and deleting bot configurations from the database.
<info added on 2025-07-03T17:24:04.135Z>
Backend API is fully implemented with 18 comprehensive endpoints for bot management including CRUD operations, lifecycle controls (start/stop/pause/resume), performance metrics, trades, positions, and configuration validation. All endpoints are secured with JWT authentication and include proper error handling.

## 9. Implement Frontend UI for Bot Creation and Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 15.8
### Description: Implement the frontend UI for creating and configuring bots.
### Details:
Create the frontend UI components for creating and configuring bots. This includes forms for entering bot parameters, selecting strategies, and configuring risk management settings. The UI should interact with the backend API to save and retrieve bot configurations.
