# Task ID: 7
# Title: Basic Logging
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up basic logging infrastructure using Winston.
# Details:
Configure Winston to log messages to files and console. Implement different log levels (info, warn, error). Include timestamps and relevant metadata in log messages. Use `pnpm add winston`. Ensure comprehensive logging for the trading engine's operations, including order execution, position tracking, and risk management.

# Test Strategy:
Test logging functionality by generating log messages and verifying their content and format. Verify that the trading engine's operations are being logged correctly, including order execution, position tracking, and risk management events.
