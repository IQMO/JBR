# Fix SMA Strategy Signal Generation

## Description
This PR addresses issues with the SMA Crossover Strategy's signal generation logic. The original implementation wasn't producing signals during backtesting due to confidence threshold issues and signal calculation problems.

## Changes Made
- Fixed signal generation in SMASignalProcessor
- Modified confidence calculation to produce more realistic values
- Adjusted crossover detection logic to be more reliable
- Added additional debugging and validation
- Created comprehensive backtesting framework for validation

## Test Results
The fixed implementation was tested against synthetic price data with clear trend patterns and successfully generated trade signals:
- Successfully detected both bullish and bearish crossovers
- Generated appropriate buy/sell signals
- Produced positive P&L in backtesting

## Documentation
Created a detailed report (SMA_STRATEGY_REPORT.md) documenting the issues found and solutions implemented.

## Validation
- [x] Fixed implementation passes all tests
- [x] Backtesting confirms strategy is working as expected
- [x] Added proper TypeScript null/undefined checks
- [x] Added comprehensive documentation
